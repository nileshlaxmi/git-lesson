# GIT Basic Overview

1. Starting a project:
    * Fresh project
    * Existing source locally
    * GitHub project (fork and clone)

* Fresh Project:

```Bash
git init fresh-project # it will create a new file and initialize with git folder

git add filename
# When files are not added, it means that files are not being tracked by git.

# By adding, file is being tracked and moved to staging area.
```
